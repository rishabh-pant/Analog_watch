# Analog_watch

Objective:
          The objective of this project is to create a graphical analog clock using Python. The clock will have hour, minute, and second hands, and will display the current time, updating in real-time. This will be achieved using the Python Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and time module to fetch the current time. The hands of the clock will rotate accordingly to represent the current time.

Tools and Libraries Used:
                          Python: The programming language used to develop the project.
                          Tkinter: A built-in Python library used to create the GUI, which will be used to draw the analog clock.
                          time: A Python module used to access the system's current time.
                          math: For calculating the positions of the clock hands based on angles.

Features:
          Displays an analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands.
          The clock updates in real-time.
          The hands of the clock rotate smoothly and in sync with the passage of time.
          Customizable appearance, such as clock size, colors, and hand thickness.

Optional features (if desired):
                                Adding clock ticks for hours and minutes.
                                Customizing the background or adding additional details like a clock border.
                                Adding sound effects or alarms.


Functionalities:
                Real-time Update: The clock will automatically update every second to reflect the current time.
                Clock Hands Movement: The hour, minute, and second hands will rotate smoothly and continuously.
                Graphical User Interface: The analog clock will be drawn inside a Tkinter window with a circular dial and rotating hands.
                Time Calculation: The angles of the clock hands will be calculated based on the current time.   

Expected Outcome:
                  When you run this Python script, a window with an analog clock will appear. The clock will have hour, minute, and second hands that move smoothly to show the current time, updating every second. The clock will be drawn on a canvas, and you will see a circular clock face with rotating hands.


Conclusion:
            This analog clock project is a great way to learn how to use Python's Tkinter library to create graphical applications. It also provides an opportunity to practice working with angles and trigonometry to position objects in a 2D space. You can further enhance the clock by adding more advanced features like alarms, clock ticks, or different clock styles.
